RavenClaw is a MUD engine written entirely in C#.

It's goals are as follows:

**To give a broad base of basic functionality in which a fully featured MUD can be developed.** The internal structure of the MUD should be easy to understand. This will help developers extend the engine as they see fit.
**It should work in both Mono and the Windows .NET environment.** Development of game areas should be easy. Preferably, an import engine that works off an XML schema should be used.
